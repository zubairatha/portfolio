        Hi! I’m <strong>Zubair Atha</strong>, an MS Data Science student at Columbia University with a background in
        Computer Science and Engineering. I’ve built and deployed end-to-end ML solutions across automotive,
        healthcare, security, and engineering services spanning real-time computer vision pipelines, large-language
        models and foundational ML models on cloud platforms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lately, I’ve been diving into AI agent architecture and high-performance model inference: designing
        multi-agent frameworks, quantizing models, and orchestrating distributed inference services. I’m passionate
        about pushing efficiency at scale and am eager to collaborate on building fast, robust AI systems in
        production.
      </p>
